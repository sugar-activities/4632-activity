ChangeLog

The different language activities, have different versions according
to when where builded.
In this file I summarize the changes in the process to have a log easier
to follow than the git log.

Version 33.5

*Improve the selection of templates when we use the select_all option

*Control the redirects in the article index
    
    Now we see as valids the links pointing to redirects,
    before, many links in the pages, pointing to redirected pages
    appear in green, when the page is included (but through a redirect)

Version 33.4

*Do not include blacklisted pages in the index

Version 33.3

* Look at the images in the language repository if is not in commons
    
    In the qu wikipedia, there are images uploaded to a qu namespace
    instead of the commons namespace. In the wikisource there are not difference
    then the code try to download it from the language space if was not posible
    download the thumbnail or the full size image.

Version 33.2

* If the downloaded image is not ok, remove the file
    
    Wikimedia reply with a html file if the image is not found
    or can't be scaled to the requested size. If we have this file
    the activity will show a broken image and not try to download it.

* Use the data directory name to define the language in setup_new_wiki.py
    
    Then now we should use "es" instead of "es_ES" for the data directory name.
    This change do easier implement other wikis as simple_en or dialects.
    In the case of need a es_es and another es_lat activities,
    we will need rename the activity.info.lang name to be the same than
    the directory used.

* Identify linktype languages for links with type length 2 or 3
    
    Before only lenght 2 where identified, but there are language codes
    with length 3 too.

* Use the first letters in the data directory to identify the language
    
    Before used th first letters in the xml data file name
    but does not work with simplewiki for example.

* Recognize images in directories if don't have the xx_xx form
    
    Until now the data directories where ever with the form xx_xx
    now we can use more simple directories names to enable us
    to create for example 'fr', 'es_lat', 'en', or 'en_simple'
    data directories.

* If needed remove template content to avoid a recursion in the template expansion
    
    The code search in the template content the template title,
    to check if there are a possible recursion.
    First try to replace the title by a error string,
    if is not possible, drop all the template content.
    This is not the best solution, but mwlib can't manage theses cases.
