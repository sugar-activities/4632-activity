"Crear uno, dos, tres... mil Wikipedias" Comandante Ernesto Wales

How to Create a new wikiactivity or update a existing activity:

1) Download a dump:

Create a directory inside the activity and download the wikipedia dump file
Wikipedia provide a daily xml files dump for every language. 
This test was done with the spanish dump. 
The file used was eswiki-20111112-pages-articles.xml.bz2 from 
http://dumps.wikimedia.org/eswiki/20110810/

The first two letters from your directry must be the language code example: es_es or en_us

mkdir es_lat
cd es_lat
bzip2 -d eswiki-20111112-pages-articles.xml.bz2

2) Process the dump file:

You need edit the file tools2/config.py, and modify the variable input_xml_file_name.
If you are creating a wikipedia in a different language to spanish,
modify the values of the other variables.

After save the config.py, you can process the dump file:

../tools2/pages_parser.py

This process will create the following files: 
eswiki-20111112-pages-articles.xml.links
eswiki-20111112-pages-articles.xml.page_templates
eswiki-20111112-pages-articles.xml.redirects
eswiki-20111112-pages-articles.xml.templates

If you want have more information, can use the option "--debug"
to create the files .all_pages, .blacklisted and .titles and help you 
to research about the process.

With the spanish file and a little more to 2.3M pages, this process
takes aprox 1:30 hours

3) Make a selection of pages:

To create a selection of pages to be included in the wikipedia activity,
you need create two files: favorites.txt and blacklist.txt
The two files are a list of titles of pages.

The criteria used to select the pages is: all the pages in favorites.txt
will be included and all the pages linked from this pages too, except the pages
in the file blacklist.txt

Our wikipedia activity have a static index page (static/index*.html)
and you can create your own index page.
The favorites.txt have all the pages linked from the index page 
(in the case of spanish 130 pages) and 300 pages more selected from 
a list of most searched pages in wikipedia (http://stats.grok.se)

There are not a linear relation between number of favorite pages and final
number of pages selected, but as reference, you can use this numbers:

            Favorites           Total selected pages
                130                     15788
                431                     45105
                544                     63347


The files favorites.txt and blacklist.txt should be in the same directory 
than the .xml file

To create the selection do:

../tools2/make_selection.py

After you have created the selection, you can look at the list of pages in the file 
pages_selected-level-1 and modify your favorites.txt and/or blacklist.txt 
files and rerun the process if you want modify the selection.

3) Create the index

../tools2/create_index.py 

This process is faster and when finished you can do a basic test:

../tools2/test_index.py page_title

and this will show you the content in wiki format of the selected page.
At this stage, the process will be slow, because need to search for every template
and do all the templates substitutions.
To have faster results we will apply templates substitutions in all the pages.  

4) Optimze the data and download images:

To expand the templates need go out of the data directory:

cd ..

./tools2/expandtemplates.py es_new/eswiki-20111112-pages-articles.xml > es_new/eswiki-20111112-pages-articles.xml.processed

If you want include images in your wikipedia activity can go again to your data directory and do:

cd es_lat
../tools2/download_images.py

This command will download the images included in the pages in favorites.txt
If you want include the images in all the pages, should do: 

../tools2/download_images.py --all

A option --cache_dir=directory is available if you have images already downloaded
in another directory to acelerate the process.


5) Create your new activity:
