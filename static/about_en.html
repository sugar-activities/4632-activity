Wikipedia is a free multilingual, open
content encyclopedia project operated by the United States-based non-profit
Wikimedia Foundation.  It attempts to collect and summarize all human
knowledge in every major language.  As of April 2008, Wikipedia had over 10
million articles in 253 languages, about a quarter of which are in English.
Wikipedia's articles have been written collaboratively by volunteers around
the world, and nearly all of its articles can be edited by anyone with access
to the Wikipedia website.
